### What Is Unit Linked Insurance Plan?

ULIP is the acronym for Unit Linked Insurance Plan. A ULIP is a combination of investment and insurance. A part of the premium amount is used to provide a life insurance cover while the remaining sum is invested to offer you the potential of wealth creation. This product is suitable for customers who want to dip their hands in the stock market while having a conservative outlook towards life. The insurance cover provided with a ULIP does just that. It provides the customer with a safety net, letting them grow their savings without any worries.
