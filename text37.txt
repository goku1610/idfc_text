<h2>Motor Insurance</h2>
<p>With the rapid increase in the number of cars plying on Indian roads, road safety has become of utmost importance for the country’s citizens. Motor insurance comes to the rescue by protecting against physical damage or loss sustained by the insured vehicle from natural and man-made calamities. The motor vehicle insurance policy also provides coverage for third-party liabilities arising out of any accidental damage, injury or death of a third party. This ensures peace of mind and security for anyone driving down the road. <a href="">Read More</a></p>

<h2>DID YOU KNOW</h2>
<h3>Factors affecting your final motor insurance price include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>IDV – IDV is the maximum amount you can claim under your policy. The higher your car’s market value, the higher your IDV and premium will be.</li>
<li>Make & model - Higher-end models are insured at a higher price simply because the cost of repairs/replacement for such vehicle is high.</li>
<li>Fuel type - Repairing petrol-fuelled cars are cheaper than those that run on diesel and CNG. As a result, they are also less expensive to insure.</li>
<li>Year of manufacture – Certain new cars may be costly to cover since their spare parts may not be available yet.</li>
<li>Location - Since urban areas have denser traffic, there’s a greater probability of accidental damages. Thus your premium may vary depending on your location.</li>
<li>Claim history – If you have made no auto insurance claims in the past year, you stand to gain a No Claim Bonus on your premium.</li>
