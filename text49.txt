## Types of Billers

### Presentment Billers

These billers provide the entire bill amount which is due. For this type of biller, you can set up autopay and you can pay off the entire amount in one transaction. You will be able to set a maximum amount for each biller. If the bill amount exceeds this limit, you will be notified immediately. 

But there are restrictions, such as:

1. You cannot make part payments.
2. You cannot make an online payment past the due date. However, you can make pre-payments.
3. You cannot make a payment till the bill is presented for payment.

### Payment Billers

These billers do not present a bill. You can choose to make ad-hoc payments to them or set up a schedule as to when, how often, and how much you want to pay them. We will not exceed the amounts you have specified for each biller.

## QuickPay

Make instant bill payments with QuickPay. It is a one-time payment without prior registration.
